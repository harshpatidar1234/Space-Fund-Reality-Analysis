# Space-Fund-Reality-Analysis
The Space Fund Realty (SFR) Analysis project evaluates aerospace companies using an SFR rating system, ranging from 1 to 9, to help investors make informed decisions. The dataset includes company details, mission payload, launch cost, orbit altitude, and other key factors influencing SFR ratings. The analysis reveals that the United States has the highest number of well-rated companies, followed by China and the United Kingdom. Most missions are small launch class, rocket-type, and focused on Low Earth Orbit. A strong correlation exists between launch cost, payload, and SFR rating, indicating that well-established companies can handle heavier payloads and invest more in their missions. Machine learning models, including Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers, achieved 87% accuracy but struggled with predicting high SFR ratings due to dataset limitations. Expanding the dataset could improve model performance and provide deeper insights. This study offers valuable guidance for investors seeking to evaluate aerospace companies based on their development and stability. Understanding these factors is crucial in navigating the rapidly evolving space industry.
